"""\
Daemon
******

This script runs in the clients rendering nodes and is responsible for spawning the
Blender Player with correct parameters, and sending feedback to the Console.

The daemon is started with command-line arguments. 
**First argument** is the network address ``host:port`` reference to contact the console.
**Second argument** is the *name* of the screen managed by that daemon.
An optional **third argument** can be ``debug`` to request activation of debugging
code in the daemon.


Messages
========


Management
----------

When started the daemon connect to the Console via its contact reference given on
command line arguments. Its first sent message is an  identification of itself with 
a command ``daemon`` giving the screen name as argument::

  daemon:"name"

If the daemon is the result of a fork, it send back to the Console a ``forked`` message
without parameter::

  forked:""

To stop the daemon, just send it a ``kill daemon`` message without parameter::

  kill daemon:""


Playing
-------

The daemon can receive a ``blender_player`` command specifying in arguments 
the parameters needed to start the blenderplayer process::

  blender_player:{'executable': "path to blenderplayer binary",
                  'option': "options to pass to executable"
                  'environments': { 'ENVIRONMENT_NAMES': 'ENVIRONMENT_VALUES' } }

If some log file has to be cleared before running the player, then the
daemon can receive a message with ``log_to_clear`` command specifying this 
file as argument::

  log_to_clear:"path to log file to remove"

Once the player context has been specified, you can indicate what file
must be played using command loader_file::

  loader_file:"file name of path to file"

To start the player, the daemon receive a ``state`` command with a bool arguments::

  state:True

To stop the player, Console can send a simple ``state`` command with a bool arguments::

    state:False

Once having a running player, the daemon send back a ``started`` command indication to the
Console, without argument::

  started:""

To explicitly stop the player, the daemon can receive a ``kill`` command, without
argument::

  kill:""

When the blender player has been started, the daemon send back a ``started`` command
without argument to the Console::

  started:""

When the blender player has been stopped, the daemon send back a ``stopped`` command
without argument to the Console::

  stopped:""


Information / Feedback
----------------------

Before starting the player, the daemon send back a ``command`` command
to the Console, specifying what local command and with what parameters will be
started::

  command:{'command': "command to start via subprocess",
           'environment': { 'ENVIRONMENT_NAMES': 'ENVIRONMENT_VALUES' },
           'path': "path to played file directory" }

In case of error, the daemon send back an ``stderr`` command with some informational
string as argument to the Console. 
It also send back this way any informations printed on the daemon's stderr stream::

  stderr:"error informations / printed informations"

In the same spirit, the daemon send back to the Console ``stdout`` commands with
string as argument for any printed line on daemon's stdout stream::

  stdout:"printed informations"
