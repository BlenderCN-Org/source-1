How to use blenderVR - LIMSI
----------------------------
There is as many blender running than there is screen in the virtual environment (wall, HMD, occulus ...). Thus, there can be several blender running on a single computer. For instance, that is used inside SMART-IÂ², where all four screens (ie. : 2 physical screens multiply by 2 - 1 stereoscopic on each screen) are rendered by the same computer.
Moreover, a Vvirtual environment may display scenes for several users. For instance, EVE, allows two users working at the same time on the same screens. Each user has its own independant stereoscopic point of view on the scene.
Thus, the XML configuration file (look at configuration/main.xml to get documentation on the configuraion file) fully describe the Virtual Environment : users, screens, VRPN connexion ...

blenderVR contains several files.
All .py files represent the classes and the modules used by blenderVR. The main module is blendervr.
